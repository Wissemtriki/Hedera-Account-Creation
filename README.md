# Hedera Account Creation

This project demonstrates how to create and manage accounts on the **Hedera Hashgraph** network using the Hedera SDK. It is a hands-on implementation focusing on understanding the lifecycle of a Hedera account, from key generation to querying account details.

## 🟦 About Hedera Hashgraph
Hedera is a high-performance distributed ledger using the **Hashgraph consensus algorithm**, which provides:
- ⚡ Fast finality (3–5 seconds)
- 🔐 aBFT-level security
- 💲 Predictable low-cost transactions
- 🌍 Governance by world-leading enterprises

It is not a blockchain, but a next-generation DLT built for real-time applications, tokenization, secure logs, and enterprise solutions.

## 🔑 What This Project Covers
This project includes:
- Generating **private & public keys**
- Creating a **new Hedera account**
- Retrieving **account ID**
- Checking **HBAR balance**
- Understanding **transaction fees**
- Using testnet credentials securely

It provides a clear reference for beginners learning how to interact with Hedera’s APIs.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Node.js or JavaScript (depending on your version)
- Hedera JavaScript SDK
- Testnet Operator ID & Private Key
- Environment variable handling (.env)

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
The goal is to make developers comfortable with the basics of:
- Hedera onboarding  
- Account management  
- Key handling  
- Running transactions on the testnet  

It is an essential foundation for building larger Hedera-based applications such as token services, smart contracts, or consensus apps.
